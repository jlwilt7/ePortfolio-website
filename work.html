            In September, I gave a church presentation on my journey from Mormonism to Orthodoxy. It goes over:
            <ol>
                <li>What is the Mormon Church?</li>
                <li>Growing Up in the Mormon Church</li>
                <li>My Journey of Faith</li>
                <li>Finding Orthodoxy</li>
                <li>Respectfully Evangelizing to Mormons</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>The Morality of Killing in War</h2>
            <div><img src="images/stgeorge.jpg" alt="St George in battle" width="100%" /></div>
            <p>
                I wrote a paper titled <i>The Morality of Killing in War</i> last year for a class. The essay explores the morality of killing in war from a Christian perspective, emphasizing Christ's teachings on pacifism and love for
                enemies. I acknowledge that war has historically been used as a tool of divine judgment, such as in the conquest of Canaan and the Christianization of Rome.
            </p>
            <p>
                I use the Bible, writings from early church fathers, and early Christian writers to prove my points. My essay also highlights the tension between the Christian call to peace and the necessity of war in a fallen, sinful
                world. Ultimately, it argues that soldiers and those in authority can serve as instruments of justice, but they must carry out their duties with caution and humility.

            <h2>Work Redeemed</h2>
            <div><img src="images/adam_working.jpg" alt="Adam, the first man, working" width="100%" /></div>
            <p>
                This essay, titled <i>Work Redeemed</i>, explores the Christian concept of vocation and how work has been redeemed through God despite the Fall. Before the Fall, Adam and Eve's work was a joyful communion with God, but
                after, it became burdensome and corrupted by sin. Gene Veith Jr.'s book God at Work emphasizes that vocation is a "mask of God," where God works through people's various callings, even in simple or secular jobs.
            </p>
            <p>
                I explain that Christians are called to see their work as a way to glorify God and serve others, restoring its divine purpose. Ultimately, vocation should be embraced as a blessing, not a curse, uniting people with God
                through service.

                In Programming I, I made a modified snake game. Instead of the snake getting longer, the snake cube speeds up when it eats the apple. Play the game below by downloading the file and running it.
