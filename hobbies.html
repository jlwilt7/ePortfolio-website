            <h2>Fly Fishing</h2>
            <div><img src="images/fly_fishing.jpg" alt="Fly Fishing" width="100%" /></div>
            <p>
                I started fly fishing at the beginning of last summer, and found that I loved it. In fly fishing, you use small fake flies that are made of feathers and thread that imitate real flies. I started by fishing for bass with the
                fly rod and have caught a lot of bass and panfish. I have fished for trout a few times here at Messiah but not to much success.

            <h2>Fly Fishing</h2>
            <div><img src="images/connor_fish.jpg" alt="My brother's bass" width="100%" /></div>
            <p>
                Before I started fly fishing, I fished for bass all the time with a spinner rod, and I still do. My grandpa would always take me out on his boat on the Juniata River. I fish pretty close to my house in Shermans Creek. Last
                summer, I took my little brother fishing and he caught a massive bass for the size of the creek we were in. Pictured above.

            <h2>Fly Tying</h2>
            <div><img src="images/flies.jpg" alt="Flies I tied" width="100%" /></div>
            <p>
                I started tying flies shortly after I started fly fishing, and I find it very rewarding to make my own "bait" for the fish I am trying to catch. The attention to detail and the beauty of the flies once they are finished
                makes it wholly worth it, though it is time consuming. Above is a picture of some flies I have tied.

            <h2>Hunting</h2>
            <div><img src="images/hunting.jpg" alt="Me hunting" width="100%" /></div>
            <p>
                I started hunting when I turned 13 and fell in love with it. I love spending time in the quiet of the woods and have also bagged two deer. Though I haven't gotten any deer in a few years simply because I haven't been able to
                hunt as much, I have high hopes for this coming season.
            </p>

            <h2>Shooting</h2>
            <div><img src="images/shooting.jpg" alt="Me shooting a gun" width="100%" /></div>
            <p>
                This summer, I got into shooting. I bought a firearm and started practicing my marksmanship. I enjoy things that go boom.

            <h2>Archery</h2>
            <div><img src="images/archery.jpg" alt="My shots with bow at an archery target" width="100%" /></div>
            <p>
                I shoot archery for fun and also to practice for hunting season. I started archery when I was 14 and have been practicing every summer in anticipation for hunting season ever since. Hopefully I can finally get a deer with my
                bow this year.

            <h2>Reading</h2>
            <div><img src="images/books.jpg" alt="My current books I am reading" width="100%" /></div>
            <p>
                I usually read spiritually enriching books. My favorite fiction author, however, is Brandon Sanderson. He writes some incredibly detailed and intriguing books. Right now I am reading the
                <i>Holy Bible</i>, <i>Confessions</i> by St Augustine, <i>The Life of the Virgin Mary</i>, and <i>Spiritual Struggle</i>
                by St Paisios the Athonite.

            <h2>Prayer Rope Making</h2>
            <div><img src="images/prayer_rope.jpg" alt="A prayer rope I made" width="100%" /></div>
            <p>
                I started making prayer ropes a few weeks ago. In the Orthodox tradition, we use prayer ropes with special knots (made of small interlocking crosses) to pray the Jesus Prayer with. Recently I have started making my own with
                cordage and beads. It is very time consuming, but very rewarding. Above is a picture of one that I made.

            <h2>Coffee</h2>
            <div><img src="images/coffee.jpg" alt="My coffee making setup" width="100%" /></div>
            <p>
                My roommate and I love making special coffees. We have beans from all around the world and enjoy new and tasty ways to make coffee. We have an espresso machine, a Turkish coffee pot, and a hand grinder amidst other supplies.
                Coffee is an essential for college students, so we make our own. Is it cheaper? Probably not, haha.

            <h2>Programming</h2>
            <div><img src="images/program.png" alt="A screenshot of a program I made" width="100%" /></div>
            <p>
                I enjoy programming in multiple languages, including Java, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and I use bash. I love making useful programs that can automate or solve problems quickly for me. Above is a screenshot of a simple
                snake game I created in my Programming I class.

            <h2>Linux</h2>
            <div><img src="images/linux.png" alt="My Linux system" width="100%" /></div>
            <p>
                I've been using Linux since for as long as I can remember. My dad is a network engineer, so Linux is his preference and we have it on all of our home computers. I enjoy using it and modifying my system, playing with settings
                and learning new commands. This interest will hopefully lead to me acquiring a future job.
