            <p>
                I began studying at Messiah University in 2023 in the cybersecurity program. In this blog post, I will detail struggles that I went through, things that I learned over the course of my first year, and the good times that I
                had. Thanks for reading!

            <h2>Beginning My Freshman Year</h2>
            <div><img src="images/lonely.jpg" alt="Lonely stock image" width="100%" /></div>
            <p>
                I was nervous going into my freshman year about making friends, managing my time correctly, and whether I would like my major. The first week I relied heavily on God as I didn't have many people to talk to. But soon, I made
                a few good friends and one of them is my current roommate.

            <h2>Learning Time Management</h2>
            <div><img src="images/clock.jpg" alt="Time alarm clock" width="100%" /></div>
            <p>
                My first semester was rough academically. Though I got good grades, I was a major procrastinator. I was able to submit most of my assignments on time, but I waited until the last minute which only made me more stressed.
                After the first semester, I decided to change my habits and get assignments done sooner rather than later. It was a big adjustment, but I have enjoyed not being as stressed about my schoolwork getting finished.
            </p>
            <h2>Going to Clubs</h2>
            <div><img src="images/club.jpg" alt="Club picture" width="100%" /></div>
            <p>
                I made several good friends at Orthodox Christian Fellowship on campus. It allowed me to network with people my age not simply about the faith, but also just as friends. I also started attending the fly fishing club once it
                started up in the spring, and the guys there helped me learn how to fly fish. I attended Messiah's Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition Team (CCDC for short) to learn more about Linux systems and Cybersecurity in general.
            </p>
            <h2>Taking Exams</h2>
            <div><img src="images/exam.jpg" alt="Students taking exams" width="100%" /></div>
            <p>
                When I first came to college, I expected exams to have similar weighting to my previous high school courses - I was dead wrong. Not only were exams much more difficult, but I had to study for them for DAYS, not mere hours.
                Admittedly, it was an adjustment. However, I started making comprehensive study guides and writing my notes to help smush all the info into my small brain.
            </p>
            <h2>Closing Out the Year</h2>
            <p>
                I closed out the year strong - stressful finals, but I got good grades. Looking back, I wouldn't have changed a thing. My struggles that year were valuable, teaching me a lot about myself, other people, and the world. I look
                forward to the coming years at Messiah University.
