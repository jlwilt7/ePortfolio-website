            <h2>Cross Country</h2>
            <div><img src="images/xc.jpg" alt="Me running an XC race" width="100%" /></div>
            <p>
                In high school, I ran cross country starting in my junior year. I learned how to push my limits and constantly work towards a goal. I also learned how to eat healthily both before and after a race. I learned that I really
                had to focus on keeping a good mindset even after failure and I needed to take care of myself.

            <h2>Track and Field</h2>
            <div><img src="images/track.jpg" alt="Track at my school" width="100%" /></div>
            <p>
                I also started track in my junior year and learned how to work as a cohesive team. I ran the 1 mile, 2 mile, and did pole vault. Sometimes I ran the 800 meter. This also taught me how to eat well, sleep well, and try my
                best.

            <h2>Project Share</h2>
            <div><img src="images/project_share.jpg" alt="Project Share logo" width="100%" /></div>
            <p>
                In high school, I used to work at project share as a volunteer and helped glean corn for those in need as well as work organizing food for homeless people. I learned how to sacrifice my time for those in need.

            <h2>Pillowcase Sewing</h2>
            <div><img src="images/sewing.jpg" alt="Sewing machine" width="100%" /></div>
            <p>
                In high school, I was part of the sewing club. We made cool pillowcases for kids with cancer in hospitals to brighten their day. I learned how to be more selfless through this project.

            <h2>Care Packages</h2>
            <div><img src="images/care_packages.jpg" alt="Care packages elephant drawing" width="100%" /></div>
            <p>
                Every year, my family organizes a day or two where we take cereal boxes and put fun toys and coloring stuff inside of them, amongst other things. We would then wrap the boxes in white paper and draw cool designs and animals
                on them for kids with cancer.
