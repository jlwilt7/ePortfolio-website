            <p>
                I am from Landisburg, PA. I was born in Carlisle Hospital. My family moved from New Bloomfield, PA, to Shermans Dale, PA, when I was a year old and moved to my current house in Landisburg in 2012. My area is quite rural and
                calm, and I like it that way. I want to live somewhere like Perry County when I graduate.

            <h2>Family</h2>
            <p>
                My parents names are Holly and Dustin Wilt. They were also born in Perry County and met through work when they were in their late teens. I also have 3 siblings: Dylan (16), Ali (14) and Connor (10). I also have two dogs, as
                stated in my home page. Pictured below is my family with a few of my cousins as well.

            <h2>Grade School</h2>
            <p>
                I attended New Bloomfield Elementary School, West Perry Middle School, and West Perry High School. I developed a strong interest in IT and programming after I took a Java Programming 1 course and a Web Development course in
                my freshman year of high school. Pictured below is my 9th grade website!
            </p>
            <div><img src="images/hunting_website.png" alt="My 9th grade website" width="100%" /></div>
            <p>
                My dad is also a Network Engineer for Community Aid so he instilled his love of computers and technology within me. I created my own websites and made a few simple java programs to help make tasks simpler for myself, such as
                a "Split Calculator" that told the user how fast they'd have to run each mile in a 5k based upon a set goal. This began my early interest in IT.
            </p>

            <h2>College</h2>
            <p>
                When searching for a college to continue my education, I decided that I wanted to go to a Christian school. I grew up Mormon and eventually became atheist then Christian. The decision to search for Christian schools if
                possible came pretty late. I eventually applied to Messiah University, and got in, thankfully. It had my major, a good program, it was close to home, and it was Christian.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now I am a sophomore here at Messiah, and I love it. I decided to pick up a Web Development minor last year and continue my interest past what I learned in my 9th Grade class. I am motivated to learn more as a hobbiest but I
                am thinking of potentially designing websites for churches that have old looking designs that need revamped.

            <h2>Major Experiences</h2>
            <h3>Getting My First Job at LEAF</h3>
            <p>
                I got my first job in my freshman year at a "farm". Though I use the word farm loosely as it was more of a large scale garden. My coworkers and I were youth interns and we were responsible for tending to the plants on the
                farm and harvesting them. This experience was big for me as it showed me how to both talk to people from different settings and farm plants. It also taught me the value of money and working for my own things.
            </p>
            <h3>Joining Cross Country & Track</h3>
            <div><img src="images/xc.jpg" alt="Running in XC" width="50%" /></div>
            <p>
                In my junior year of high school I decided to join the cross country team after much deliberation. COVID left me simultaneously starving for social interaction and afraid of it, haha. But I joined and made a lot of friends
                there and broke many records in 5k races.
            </p>
            <h3>Leaving the Mormon Church</h3>
            <div><img src="images/mormon_temple.jpg" alt="Mormon Temple" width="100%" /></div>
            <p>
                In my junior year I also decided to leave my parents church, which was a big shocker to them, naturally. I just did not really believe in God anymore and needed to have some room to breathe from their religion. Over the next
                year or so, I became more agnostic in my thinking until I started to attend my friend's Non-Denominational church as I wanted to find meaning in life.
            </p>
            <h3>Getting the Job at Sheetz</h3>
            <div><img src="images/sheetz.jpg" alt="Sheetz" width="100%" /></div>
            <p>
                In my senior year I had finally gotten my license and applied to Sheetz. I interviewed for the position and got the job and have been working there since then.
            </p>
            <h3>Joining the Orthodox Church</h3>
            <div><img src="images/chrismation.jpg" alt="Chrismation at Church" width="50%" /></div>
            <p>
                In March 2023 I decided to attend an Orthodox Church for the first time, and fell in love with the faith. I had been feeling empty and confused in my protestant tradition and needed a change. I was catechized a few months
                after my first attendance and then spent the next year learning. I was baptized in April of 2024.
            </p>
            <h3>Going to Messiah University</h3>
            <div><img src="images/messiah_university.jpg" alt="Messiah University" width="100%" /></div>
            <p>
                2023 was my first year at Messiah, and while it was a rough start trying to keep my head screwed on with all of my school work, I eventually got the hang of it. I made a good friend group, got good grades, and learned a lot.
                I am still enjoying my major and my time here.
