            <h2>Faith Activities</h2>

            <p>
                I am an "usher" at my church. If I spot someone new, I make sure that they receive the bulletin for the week, the service book, and teach them about what is happening at my church.
            </p>
            <p>
                I attend Vespers and Sunday Liturgy at my church and attend the weekly Bible study.

            <h2>Family Events</h2>
            <p>
                My family on my dad's side gathers every Sunday afternoon for a campfire and food. We have fun conversations, play games, and make food. My cousins and I typically play Ultimate Frisbee while our parents talk. We also play
                with my dogs.
            </p>
            <p>
                My family also gathers on all of the major holidays. For halloween, we go to all of the parades and my younger family members trick or treat. For Thanksgiving, we go to my aunt's house and have a big family meal. For
                Christmas, my grandparents rent out the senior center in New Bloomfield. My household makes "reindeer food", wraps presents, and we do gift exchanges amongst us siblings. For Easter, we hide Easter baskets.
            </p>

            <h2>Friendships</h2>
            <div><img src="images/supersmash.jpg" alt="Super Smash Bros" width="100%" /></div>
            <p>
                I have a few friends on my floor (and off my floor) here at Messiah. We usually get lunch and dinner together and attend chapels. Many of my friends also attend church with me. In addition, we usually go to Sheetz at least
                once a week to get food. We also love playing Super Smash Bros on my friend's Nintendo Switch Console.
            </p>

            <h2>School Opportunities</h2>
            <div><img src="images/flyfishing.jpg" alt="Fly Fishing" width="100%" /></div>
            <p>
                As for school clubs, I go to the Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition Team every other week and learn about hacking (red and blue team). I also attend the Messiah Fly Fishing club, which is active throughout the whole year.
                In addition, I go to Orthdox Christian Fellowship to spend time with other Orthodox Christians on campus having fun and learning more about the faith.
