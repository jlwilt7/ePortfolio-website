                Hi! I am <a href="about.html">Johnathon Wilt</a>. I am a sophomore at Messiah University. I am a Cybersecurity major with a Web Development minor. I grew up in Perry County, PA (a very rural area close to Mechanicsburg, PA).
                I have four siblings two dogs: an American Eskimo named Ace and a Golden Retreiver named Miles.

                In this website, you will find information on a wide variety of things in my life, such as who I am, my resume, my hobbies, activities I am involved in, where I work, my work experience, and a page to contact me if you so
                desire!

            <h2>My Values</h2>
            <p>
                As you already know, I go to Messiah University. My values are based upon Jesus Christ and His Orthodox Church. I was baptized into the Orthodox Church in April 2024 and Christ's teachings and Church guide my life and inform
                my values. My faith plays a central role in my life. While I am not as good of a Christian as I could be, I try my best to be honest, hardworking, and patient.
            </p>

            <h2>Things I am Passionate About</h2>
            <p>
                I am passionate about learning more about the Cybersecurity world. I love learning new things about the internet, especially Linux systems. I've been using Linux since I was 5 when my dad installed it on all of our systems.
                It was just his preference.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am passionate about a few social issues, but especially abortion as I believe that it is highly immoral and must stop happening in the world. I attend anti-abortion clubs and protests sometimes.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am also passionate about helping others with issues that they are going through in their lives. If I can help someone work through an issue or give them advice that would help them go what they are going through, I am very
                happy. Many times, they are struggling through the same things that I am and so I can help them.
            </p>

            <h2>My Favorite YouTube Video</h2>
            <p>I love to fly fish, and this YouTuber I watch has both great energy and great footage of his fishing trips. This is my favorite video because of the massive wild Chinook (King) Salmon he caught.</p>
